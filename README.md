# Leighton_CSCI2270_FinalProject: Text analyzer with login system
Christopher Leighton's final project for CSCI 2270

Summary:

This program will feature an authentication system through which users can create accounts and log into them.  This will be implemented with a binary search tree (this might be converted to a red-black tree in a future version).  It will feature features like checking if a username a user is trying to create already exists and refusing them if that is the case.  In a demonstration of my prowess in cryptography, the usernames and passwords will be stored in a plain text file.  Each time the program is started, it will read the text file and rebuild the database.  Upon login, the user will have several options, one of which will be to enter a length of text which the program will analyze in various ways (calculating most used words, calculating average word length, etc).  The user will at this point also have the option to export the analysis of their text into a text file, change their password, or delete their account.  Other features may be added as the program is developed.
